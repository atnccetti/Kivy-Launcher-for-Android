# launcherKivyAndroid

Launcher to include kivy Application in playstore, this application is in extremely beta phase, the documentation and comments are not yet fully in English, and the code is not improved, this project was done quickly to provide a temporary solution for kivy users who wish to include their application in the store, but can not because they have problems with Api 26-27-28, this software makes use of reverse engineering methods using Apktools to make inclusion possible.
